## Data files for Software Carpentry novice R lessons

This repository is for teaching at bootcamps.
Students should clone the repo by running:

    git clone git@github.com:jdblischak/swc-novice-r.git

To help with issues navigating to the correct working directory, it also contains an RStudio project file.
Thus students have the choice of either navigating to the files from the Shell or the filesystem navigator on their OS.
